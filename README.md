# Storing and Fetching Values in Java

**Assumptions**

The `key-value` program was developed on Ubuntu 20.04 and relies on the
shebang mechanism. This is to meet the requirement for starting the
program via `./key-value` from the command line.

Intellij-IDEA CE was used to develop and output the already compiled artifacts.
Artifacts are referenced in the `key-value` Java/script file. There
should hopefully be no need to compile anything.

**Adopt-openJDK 14 was used for development. Please have this or an
equivalent JDK installed**

---

**Running**

Run the `key-value` executable file by entering `./key-value`.
